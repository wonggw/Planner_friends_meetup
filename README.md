Everybody schedule is busy.
Just a simple script to optimize the meetup base on the number of people available. Also, higher weightage are given to those who provide less unavailable date.

To edit the data. Open data.csv. Change the name and date unavailable. 
For the unavailable "1-20" follow this format. You can also add multiple range of unavailable dates. Put "nil" if u are avaliable everyday.

This script will only calculate for that individual month. to edit the number of day in the month and the date today, open planner.py and edit the variable.
